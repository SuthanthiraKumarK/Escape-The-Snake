# Escape-The-Snake

It's a Single player game.

The Game motive is to reach the endpoint, with least amount of life value.

If we are on the snake tiles, our life value decreases.

We can pause/continue the game & also can restart the game as our desire.

If you are in tile-95, then dice value 6 wont be considered in the game. & our player emoji wont move. In this situation, if we are on the snake tile, our life will decrease.

Same as for tile-96 & dice-5, tile-97 & dice-4, tile-98 & dice-3, tile-99 & dice-2. in this time there
